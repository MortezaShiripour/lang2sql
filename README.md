## Motivation

The rapid development of natural language models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has presented numerous possibilities for various fields. One of the most common applications is using LLMs for coding. For instance, OpenAI's chatGPT and Meta's Code LLAMA are LLMs that offer state-of-the-art natural language to code generators. One potential use case is a natural language to SQL code generator, which could assist non-technical professionals with simple data requests and hopefully enable the data teams to focus on more data-intensive tasks. This tutorial focuses on setting up a language for SQL code generator using the OpenAI API.

### What can you do with language to SQL code generator application?

One possible application is a chatbot that can respond to user queries with relevant data (Figure 1). The chatbot can be integrated with a Slack channel using a Python application that performs the following steps: 
- Receives the user's question 
- Converts the question into a prompt
- Sends a GET request to the OpenAI API with the prompt 
- Parses the returned JSON into a SQL query 
- Sends the query to the database 
- Returns the user a CSV file containing the relevant data

<br>
<br />

In this tutorial, we will build a step-by-step Python application that converts user questions into SQL queries.

## Scope and General Architecture

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a Python application that converts general questions into SQL queries using the OpenAI API. That includes the following functionality:
- Generalized - the application is not limited to a specific table and can be used on any table
- For simplicity, the application is limited to a single table (e.g., no joins)
- Dockerized - develop the application inside a dockerized environment for a simple deployment

Figure 2 below describes the general architecture of a simple language to SQL code generator.

<br>
<br />

The scope and focus of this tutorial is on the green box - building the following functionality:
- **Question to Prompt** - transform the question into a prompt format:    
    - Pull the table information to create the prompt context
    - Add the question to the prompt

- **API Handler** - a function that works with the OpenAI API:
    - Send a GET request with the prompt
    - Parse the answer into an SQL query
- **DB Handler** - a function that sends the SQL query to the database and returns the required data

## Prerequisites

The main prerequisite for this tutorial is basic knowledge of Python. That includes the following functionality:
- Setting Python functions and objects
- Working with tabular data (i.e., pandas, CSV, etc.) and non-structure data format(i.e., JSON, etc.)
- Working with Python libraries 

In addition, basic knowledge of SQL and access to the OpenAI API are required.

### Nice to Have

While not necessary, having a basic knowledge of Docker is helpful, as the tutorial was created in a Dockerized environment using VScode's Dev Containers extension. If you don't have experience with Docker or the extension, you can still run the tutorial by creating a virtual environment and installing the required packages (as described below). Knowledge of Prompt engineering and the OpenAI API is also beneficial.

I created a detailed tutorial about setting a Python dockerized environment with VScode and the Dev Containers extension:

https://github.com/RamiKrispin/vscode-python

### Python Libraries

To set up a natural language to SQL code generation, we will use the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` - to process data throughout the process
- `duckdb` - to simulate the work with the database
- `openai` - to work with the OpenAI API
- `time` and `os` - to load CSV files and format fields 


If you are not using the tutorial dockerized environment, you can create a local virtual environment from the command line using the script below:

```shell
ENV_NAME=openai_api
PYTHON_VER=3.10
conda create -y --name $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VER 

conda activate $ENV_NAME

pip3 install -r ./.devcontainer/requirements_core.txt
pip3 install -r ./.devcontainer/requirements_openai.txt

```

**Note:** I used `conda` and it should work as well with any other virutal environment method.

We use the `ENV_NAME` and `PYTHON_VER` variables to set the virtual environment and the Python version, respectively.

To confirm that your environment is properly set, use the `conda list` to confirm that the required Python libraries are installed. You should expect the below output:

```shell
(openai_api) root@0ca5b8000cd5:/workspaces/lang2sql# conda list

### Setting Access to the OpenAI API

We will use the OpenAI API to access chatGPT using the text-davinci-003 engine. This required an active OpenAI account and API key. It is straightforward to set an account and API key following the instructions in the below link:

https://openai.com/product

Once you set the access to the API and a key, I recommend adding the key as an environment variable to your `.zshrc` file (or any other format you are using to store environment variables on your shell system). I stored my API key under the `OPENAI_KEY` environment variable.  For convincing reasons, I recommend you use the same naming convention.

To set the variable on the `.zshrc` file (or equivalent), add the below line to the file:

```shell
export OPENAI_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

If using VScode or running from the terminal, you must restart your session after adding the variable to the `.zshrc` file.


## Data

In order to simulate database functionality, we will be utilizing the [Chicago Crime](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2) dataset. This dataset provides in-depth information regarding the crimes recorded in the city of Chicago since 2001. With close to 8 million records and 22 columns, the dataset includes information such as the crime classification, location, time, result, etc. The data is available to download from the Chicago Data Portal. Since we store the data locally as Pandas data frame and use DuckDB to simulate SQL query, we will download a subset of the data using the last three years.


<figure>
<img src="images/chicago_crime.png" width="100%" align="center"/></a>
<figcaption> Figure 3 - The Chicago Crime dataset</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>
<br />


You can pull the data from the API or download a CSV file. To avoid calling the API each time I run the script, I download the files and store them under the data folder. Below are the links to the datasets by year:
- [2021](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2021/dwme-t96c)
- [2022](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2022/9hwr-2zxp)
- [2023](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2023/xguy-4ndq)

To download the data, use the `Export` button on the top right side, select the `CSV` option, and click the `Download` button, as seen in Figure 4.


<figure>
<img src="images/chicago_crime_download.png" width="100%" align="center"/></a>
<figcaption> Figure 4 - Download a full year of data as the CSV file using the Export option</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>
<br />

I used the following naming convention - chicago_crime_YEAR.csv and saved the files in the `data` folder. Each file size is close to 50 Mb. Therefore, I added them to the git ignore file under the `data` folder, and they are not available on this repo. After downloading the files and setting their names, you should have the following files in the folder:
```shell
|‚îÄ‚îÄ data
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chicago_crime_2021.csv
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chicago_crime_2022.csv
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chicago_crime_2023.csv

```

**Note:** As of the time of creating this tutorial, the data for 2023 is still getting updated. Therefore, you may receive slightly different results when running some of the queries in the following section.

<br>
<br />

## Setting up a SQL Generator

Let's move on to the exciting part, which is setting up a SQL code generator. In this section, we'll create a Python function that takes in a user's question, the associated SQL table, and the OpenAI API key and outputs the SQL query that answers the user's question.

Let's start by loading the Chicago Crime dataset and the required packages.

### Load Dependencies and Data

First thing first - let's load the required packages:
```python
import pandas as pd
import duckdb
import openai
import time 
import os
```

We will utilize the **os** and **time** packages to load CSV files and reformat certain fields. The data will be processed using the **pandas** package, and we will simulate SQL commands with the **DuckDB** package. Lastly, we will establish a connection to the OpenAI API using the **openai** package.


Next, we will load the `CSV` files from the data folder. The code below reads all the `CSV` files available in the data folder: 

```python
path = "./data"

files = [x for x in os.listdir(path = path) if ".csv" in x]
```
If you downloaded the corresponding files for the years 2021 to 2023 and used the same naming convention, you should expect the following output:

``` python
print(files)

['chicago_crime_2022.csv', 'chicago_crime_2023.csv', 'chicago_crime_2021.csv']
```

Next, we will read and load all the files and append them into a pandas data frame:

```python 
chicago_crime = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(path +"/" + f) for f in files), ignore_index=True)

chicago_crime.head

```

If you loaded the files correctly, you should expect the following output:

```python 
<bound method NDFrame.head of               ID Case Number                    Date                   Block

### Prompt Enineering 101

Before we get into the Python code, let's pause and review how prompt engineering works and how we can help ChatGPT (and generally any LLM) generate the best results. We will use in this section the [ChatGPT web interface](https://chat.openai.com/).

One major factor in statistical and machine learning models is that the output quality depends on the input quality. As the famous phrase says - *junk-in, junk-out*. Similarly, the quality of the LLM output depends on the quality of the prompt. 

For example, let's assume we want to count the number of cases that ended up with an arrest.

If we use the following prompt:
```
Create an SQL query that counts the number of records that ended up with an arrest.
```
Here is the output from ChatGPT:

<figure>
<img src="images/prompt_ex1.png" width="100%" align="center"/></a>
<figcaption> Figure 5 - Basic prompt without context</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>
<br />

It's worth noting that ChatGPT provides a generic response. Although it's generally correct, it may not be practical to use in an automated process. Firstly, the field names in the response don't match the ones in the actual table we need to query. Secondly, the field that represents the arrest outcome is a boolean (`true` or `false`) instead of an integer (`0` or `1`).

ChatGPT, in that sense, acts like a human. It's unlikely that you will receive a more accurate answer from a human by posting the same question on a coding form like Stack Overflow or any other similar platform. Given that we did not provide any context or additional information about the table characteristics, expecting ChatGPT to guess the field names and their values would be unreasonable. The context is a crucial factor in any prompt. To illustrate this point, let's see how ChatGPT handles the following prompt:

```
I have a table named chicago_crime with the crime records in Chicago City since 2021. The Arrest field defines if the case ended up with arrest or not, and it is a boolean (true or false).  

I want to create an SQL query that counts the number of records that ended up with an arrest.
```

Here is the output from ChatGPT:

<figure>
<img src="images/prompt_ex2.png" width="100%" align="center"/></a>
<figcaption> Figure 5 - Basic prompt without context</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>
<br />

This time, after adding context, ChatGPT returned a correct query that we can use as is. Generally, when working with a text generator, the prompt should include two components - context and request. In the above prompt, the first paragraph represents the prompt's context:

```
I have a table named chicago_crime with the crime records in Chicago City since 2021. The Arrest field defines if the case ended up with arrest or not, and it is a boolean (true or false). 
```
Where the second paragraph, represents the request:
```
I want to create an SQL query that counts the number of records that ended up with an arrest.
```

The OpenAI API refers to the context as a `system` and request as a `user`.

The OpenAI API documentation provides a [recommendation](https://platform.openai.com/examples/default-sql-translate) for how to set the `system` and `user` components in a prompt when requesting to generate an SQL code:



`System`
```
Given the following SQL tables, your job is to write queries given a user‚Äôs request.

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  OrderID int,
  CustomerID int,
  OrderDate datetime,
  OrderTime varchar(8),
  PRIMARY KEY (OrderID)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
  OrderDetailID int,
  OrderID int,
  ProductID int,
  Quantity int,
  PRIMARY KEY (OrderDetailID)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
  ProductID int,
  ProductName varchar(50),
  Category varchar(50),
  UnitPrice decimal(10, 2),
  Stock int,
  PRIMARY KEY (ProductID)
);

CREATE TABLE Customers (
  CustomerID int,
  FirstName varchar(50),
  LastName varchar(50),
  Email varchar(100),
  Phone varchar(20),
  PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID)
);
```

`User`
```
Write a SQL query which computes the average total order value for all orders on 2023-04-01.
```

In the next section, we will use the above OpenAI example and generalize it into a general-purpose template.
