## Motivation

The rapid development of natural language models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has presented numerous possibilities for various fields. One of the most common applications is using LLMs for coding. For instance, OpenAI's chatGPT and Meta's Code LLAMA are LLMs that offer state-of-the-art natural language to code generators. One potential use case is a natural language to SQL code generator, which could assist non-technical professionals with simple data requests and hopefully enable the data teams to focus on more data-intensive tasks. This tutorial focuses on setting up a language for SQL code generator using the OpenAI API.

### What can you do with language to SQL code generator application?

One possible application is a chatbot that can respond to user queries with relevant data (Figure 1). The chatbot can be integrated with a Slack channel using a Python application that performs the following steps: 
- Receives the user's question 
- Converts the question into a prompt
- Sends a GET request to the OpenAI API with the prompt 
- Parses the returned JSON into a SQL query 
- Sends the query to the database 
- Returns the user a CSV file containing the relevant data

In this tutorial, we will build a step-by-step Python application that converts user questions into SQL queries.

## Scope and General Architecture

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a Python application that converts general questions into SQL queries using the OpenAI API. That includes the following functionality:
- Generalized - the application is not limited to a specific table and can be used on any table
- For simplicity, the application is limited to a single table (e.g., no joins)
- Dockerized - develop the application inside a dockerized environment for a simple deployment

Figure 2 below describes the general architecture of a simple language to SQL code generator.

The scope and focus of this tutorial is on the green box - building the following functionality:
- **Question to Prompt** - transform the question into a prompt format:    
    - Pull the table information to create the prompt context
    - Add the question to the prompt

- **API Handler** - a function that works with the OpenAI API:
    - Send a GET request with the prompt
    - Parse the answer into an SQL query
- **DB Handler** - a function that sends the SQL query to the database and returns the required data
