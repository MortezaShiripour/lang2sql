## Motivation

The rapid development of natural language models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has presented numerous possibilities for various fields. One of the most common applications is using LLMs for coding. For instance, OpenAI's chatGPT and Meta's Code LLAMA are LLMs that offer state-of-the-art natural language to code generators. One potential use case is a natural language to SQL code generator, which could assist non-technical professionals with simple data requests and hopefully enable the data teams to focus on more data-intensive tasks. This tutorial focuses on setting up a language for SQL code generator using the OpenAI API.

### What can you do with language to SQL code generator application?

One possible application is a chatbot that can respond to user queries with relevant data (Figure 1). The chatbot can be integrated with a Slack channel using a Python application that performs the following steps: 
- Receives the user's question 
- Converts the question into a prompt
- Sends a GET request to the OpenAI API with the prompt 
- Parses the returned JSON into a SQL query 
- Sends the query to the database 
- Returns the user a CSV file containing the relevant data

In this tutorial, we will build a step-by-step Python application that converts user questions into SQL queries.

## Scope and General Architecture

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a Python application that converts general questions into SQL queries using the OpenAI API. That includes the following functionality:
- Generalized - the application is not limited to a specific table and can be used on any table
- For simplicity, the application is limited to a single table (e.g., no joins)
- Dockerized - develop the application inside a dockerized environment for a simple deployment

Figure 2 below describes the general architecture of a simple language to SQL code generator.

</figure>


The scope and focus of this tutorial is on the green box - building the following functionality:
- **Question to Prompt** - transform the question into a prompt format:    
    - Pull the table information to create the prompt context
    - Add the question to the prompt

- **API Handler** - a function that works with the OpenAI API:
    - Send a GET request with the prompt
    - Parse the answer into an SQL query
- **DB Handler** - a function that sends the SQL query to the database and returns the required data

## Prerequisites

The main prerequisite for this tutorial is basic knowledge of Python. That includes the following functionality:
- Setting Python functions and objects
- Working with tabular data (i.e., pandas, CSV, etc.) and non-structure data format(i.e., JSON, etc.)
- Working with Python libraries 

In addition, basic knowledge of SQL and access to the OpenAI API are required.

### Nice to Have

While not necessary, having a basic knowledge of Docker is helpful, as the tutorial was created in a Dockerized environment using VScode's Dev Containers extension. If you don't have experience with Docker or the extension, you can still run the tutorial by creating a virtual environment and installing the required packages (as described below). Knowledge of Prompt engineering and the OpenAI API is also beneficial.

I created a detailed tutorial about setting a Python dockerized environment with VScode and the Dev Containers extension:

https://github.com/RamiKrispin/vscode-python

### Python Libraries

To set up a natural language to SQL code generation, we will use the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` - to process data throughout the process
- `duckdb` - to simulate the work with the database
- `openai` - to work with the OpenAI API
- `time` and `os` - to load CSV files and format fields 


If you are not using the tutorial dockerized environment, you can create a local virtual environment from the command line using the script below:

```shell
ENV_NAME=openai_api
PYTHON_VER=3.10
conda create -y --name $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VER 

conda activate $ENV_NAME

pip3 install -r ./.devcontainer/requirements_core.txt
pip3 install -r ./.devcontainer/requirements_openai.txt

```

**Note:** I used `conda` and it should work as well with any other virutal environment method.

We use the `ENV_NAME` and `PYTHON_VER` variables to set the virtual environment and the Python version, respectively.

To confirm that your environment is properly set, use the `conda list` to confirm that the required Python libraries are installed. You should expect the below output:

```shell
(openai_api) root@0ca5b8000cd5:/workspaces/lang2sql# conda list

### Setting Access to the OpenAI API

We will use the OpenAI API to access chatGPT using the text-davinci-003 engine. This required an active OpenAI account and API key. It is straightforward to set an account and API key following the instructions in the below link:

https://openai.com/product

Once you set the access to the API and a key, I recommend adding the key as an environment variable to your `.zshrc` file (or any other format you are using to store environment variables on your shell system). I stored my API key under the `OPENAI_KEY` environment variable.  For convincing reasons, I recommend you use the same naming convention.

To set the variable on the `.zshrc` file (or equivalent), add the below line to the file:

```shell
export OPENAI_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

If using VScode or running from the terminal, you must restart your session after adding the variable to the `.zshrc` file.
